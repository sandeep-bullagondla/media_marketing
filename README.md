# media_marketing 

This project is regrading MMM on revenue generated, we have indpendent variables such spending on 3 different media platforms, competitor sales and newsletter subscription. 
Initially we build classical modelling then we add temporal effects as there is seasonality in the revenue data. Later Bayesian Modeling is built to consider interval estimates rather than point estimates.
